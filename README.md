# Data-Science
## Introduction to Data Science
 Data Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover hidden patterns from the raw data. 
Data Science is primarily used to make decisions and predictions making use of predictive causal analytics, prescriptive analytics (predictive plus decision science) and machine learning.

  # <h1> Data Science Goals and deliverables
* Prediction (predict a value based on inputs)
* Classification (e.g., spam or not spam)
* Recommendations (e.g., Amazon and Netflix recommendations)
* Pattern detection and grouping (e.g., classification without known classes)
* Anomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)
* Recognition (image, text, audio, video, facial, …)
* Actionable insights (via dashboards, reports, visualizations, …)
* Automated processes and decision-making (e.g., credit card approval)
* Scoring and ranking (e.g., FICO score)
* Segmentation (e.g., demographic-based marketing)
* Optimization (e.g., risk management)
* Forecasts (e.g., sales and revenue)

Phase 1—The required resources present in terms of people, technology, time and data to support the project. In this phase, you also need to frame the business problem and formulate initial hypotheses (IH) to test.
Data preparation: You need to explore, preprocess and condition data prior to modeling. Further, you will perform ETLT (extract, transform, load and transform) to get data into the sandbox. Let’s have a look at the Statistical Analysis flow below

# <h1> Model Planning 
  
 We will determine the methods and techniques to draw
 the relationships between variables. These relationships
 will set the base for the algorithms which you will 
Implement in the next phase. You will apply Exploratory
 Data Analytics (EDA) using various statistical formulas and visualization tools.
* __R__ has a complete set of modeling capabilities and 
provides a good environment for building interpretive 
models.
* __SQL Analysis services__ can perform in-database
 analytics using common data mining functions and 
basic predictive models.
* __SAS/ACCESS__  can be used to access data from
Hadoop and is used for creating repeatable and reusable 
model flow diagrams. Although, many tools are present 
in the market but R is the most commonly used tool
